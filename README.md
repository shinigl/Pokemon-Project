# Pokémon Card Viewer Project

This project uses the **Pokémon API** to dynamically fetch Pokémon data and display it in the form of interactive Pokémon cards. Each card contains detailed information about a Pokémon, such as its name, image, types, abilities, and stats.

## How It Works

1. On page load, the app makes a request to the **Pokémon API** to fetch data for all available Pokémon.
2. The data is used to create cards dynamically with Pokémon images, names, types, and basic stats.
3. When you click on a card, you can see additional details such as abilities and stats for that specific Pokémon.
4. The app is fully responsive, allowing you to view the cards on both desktop and mobile devices.
